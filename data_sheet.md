## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
	- This event log was extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNow platform used by an IT company and enriched with data loaded from a relational database
	- The primary purpose of creation of database was to facilitate the machile learning model development to address various areas of incident management
	
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
	- As per the archives, this data was originally created by:
		Claudio Aparecido Lira do Amaral, claudio.amaral '@' usp.br, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
		Marcelo Fantinato, m.fantinato '@' usp.br, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
		Sarajane Marques Peres, sarajane '@' usp.br, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil


 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
	-- This is an event log of an incident management process extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNowTM platform used by an IT company. 
	   The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system.
	   Information was anonymized for privacy 
	   
- How many instances of each type are there? 
	-- Number of instances: 141,712 events (24,918 incidents)
	   Number of attributes: 36 attributes (1 case identifier, 1 state identifier, 32 descriptive attributes, 2 dependent variables)

- Is there any missing data?
	-- Yes
	
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
	-- The data has been anonymized for privacy. The current dataset does not contain any private or confidential information.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
	-- This is an event log of an incident management process extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNowTM platform used by an IT company. 
	   The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system
	   
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
	-- This is an entire dataset
	
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
	-- Information unavailable

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
	-- The data was anonymized for privacy. No other pre-processing is mentioned
	
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
	-- Information unavailable
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
	-- The dataset can be used in creating machine learning models
	
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
	-- In my knowledge, there is no such risks with the usage of this data
	
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
	-- Information unavailable

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
	-- This data is publicly available
	
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
	-- This data is publicly available with citation requests

## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
	-- To the best of my knowledge, this data is no longer being maintained.
